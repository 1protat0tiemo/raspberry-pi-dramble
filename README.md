# Raspberry Pi Dramble

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-dramble.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-dramble)

> **NOTE**: This project is currently being converted to use Kubernetes as the foundational layer of the Drupal site infrastructure. Please [check out the `kubernetes` branch](https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-dramble/tree/kubernetes) and see its README for more info.

A cluster ([Bramble](http://elinux.org/Bramble)) of Raspberry Pis on which Drupal will be deployed using Ansible.

Read the rest of this README and the official [Dramble Wiki](http://www.pidramble.com/wiki) for more information about the Dramble.

## Why

I'm doing presentations on Ansible, and how easy it makes infrastructure configuration, even for high-performance/high-availability Drupal sites. WiFi/Internet access is spotty at most conferences, so deploying to AWS, DigitalOcean, or other live public cloud instances that require a stable Internet connection is a Bad Ideaâ„¢.

Deploying to VMs on my own presentation laptop is an option (and I've done this in the past), but it's not quite as impactful as deploying to real, live, 'in-the-flesh' servers. Especially if you can say you're carrying around a datacenter in your bag!

A cluster of servers, in my hand, at the presentation. With blinking LEDs!

## Official Site

You can browse more information about _geerlingguy_'s Dramble on [http://www.pidramble.com/](http://www.pidramble.com/). This website is actually running on the Rasbperry Pi Dramble cluster pictured above!

## Specs

  - 24 ARMv7 CPU Cores
  - 5.4 GHz combined compute power
  - 6 GB RAM
  - 96 GB microSD flash-based storage
  - 1 Gbps private network

## Getting the Pis (and other accessories)

Many people have asked for a basic list of components used in constructing the Dramble, or where I found particular parts. In the Wiki, I've added pages listing the following:

  - [Raspberry Pis and Accessories](http://www.pidramble.com/wiki/hardware/pis)
  - [Other Necessities](http://www.pidramble.com/wiki/hardware/necessities)
  - [Recommended Extras](http://www.pidramble.com/wiki/hardware/extras)

## Setting up the Pis

The process for setting up all the Raspberry Pis is outlined in the Wiki:

  1. [Prepare the Raspberry Pis for provisioning](http://www.pidramble.com/wiki/setup/prepare)
  2. [Rack the Raspberry Pis](http://www.pidramble.com/wiki/setup/rack)
  3. [Network the Raspberry Pis](http://www.pidramble.com/wiki/setup/network)
  4. [Test the Ansible configuration](http://www.pidramble.com/wiki/setup/test-ansible)
  5. [Provision the Raspberry Pis](http://www.pidramble.com/wiki/setup/provision)
    - TODO: This documentation might need updating for Kubernetes.
  6. [Deploy Drupal to the Raspberry Pis](http://www.pidramble.com/wiki/setup/deploy-drupal)
    - TODO: This documentation might need updating for Kubernetes.

### Benchmarks - Testing the performance of the Dramble

See the [Pi Dramble Benchmarks](http://www.pidramble.com/wiki/benchmarks) section of the Wiki for current benchmarks and statistics.

## Drupal on a Single Pi - Drupal Pi

If you have only a single Raspberry Pi, you can use the [Drupal Pi](https://github.com/geerlingguy/drupal-pi) project to quickly get Drupal running on the single Pi.

## Using older or slower Raspberry Pi models

The Raspberry Pi 2, 3, and 3 B+ have quad-core processors that make certain operations four to ten times faster than single-core Pis like the A+, B+, Zero, etc. Additionally, cluster members need as much RAM as possible, and any Pi without at least 1 GB of RAM is woefully underpowered for this setup.

Therefore only the following Pi models are officially supported at this time:

  - Raspberry Pi model 3 B+
  - Raspberry Pi model 3 B
  - Raspberry Pi model 2
