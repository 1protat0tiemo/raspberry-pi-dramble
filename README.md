# Raspberry Pi Dramble

A cluster ([Bramble](http://elinux.org/Bramble)) of 5 Raspberry Pis on which Drupal will be deployed using Ansible.

## Why

I'm doing presentations on Ansible, and how easy it makes infrastructure configuration, even for high-performance/high-availability Drupal sites. WiFi/Internet access is spotty at most conferences, so deploying to AWS, DigitalOcean, or other live public cloud instances that require a stable Internet connection is a Bad Ideaâ„¢.

Deploying to VMs on my own presentation laptop is an option (and I've done this in the past), but it's not quite as impactful as deploying to real, live, 'in-the-flesh' servers. Especially if you can say you're carrying around a datacenter in your bag!

## Specs

  - 24 ARMv7 CPU Cores
  - 5.4 GHz combined compute power
  - 6 GB RAM
  - 96 GB microSD-based storage
  - 64 GB SSD-based storage
  - 1 Gbps private network

As you can see from the above specs; it takes 5+ Raspberry Pis to equal the capacity of one moderate workstation nowadays. Raspberry Pis are not the most economical or power-saving way to build Drupal infrastructure, but they are great for educational purposes, and it's a fun project to build 'bare metal' infrastructure with your own hands!

## Getting the Pis (and other accessories)

For the Dramble, I purchased the following:

  - 6x Raspberry Pi 2 Model B
  - 1x [50W 6-port USB desktop charger](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KHP6UVQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00KHP6UVQ&linkCode=as2&tag=httpwwwmidw06-20&linkId=YEKQEOUTP3WTLSJJ) (to provide juice to the Pis)
  - 1x [6-pack micro USB cables](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00N8VHW72/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00N8VHW72&linkCode=as2&tag=httpwwwmidw06-20&linkId=63VSGWYRPJFO4IZO) (plugs from charger to Pis - cheap in bulk!)
  - 1x [5-pack 8GB microSD cards](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KI16OOW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00KI16OOW&linkCode=as2&tag=httpwwwmidw06-20&linkId=JM2T4CPMOOJA44AW) (one for each Pi, cheap in bulk!)
    - Note that I'm actually using a hodgepodge of different microSD cards for different servers, as I've found pretty wide performance gaps in real-world usage on the Pi. My current top contender for price-performance is the SanDisk Extreme microSD card.
  - 1x [8-port unmanaged Gigabit network switch](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QUA6RA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001QUA6RA&linkCode=as2&tag=httpwwwmidw06-20&linkId=24SPP5YZJR6KK7GH) (for inter-Pi networking)
  - 1x [Raspberry Pi B+ Stackable Case Triplestack](http://www.ebay.com/itm/271648357906)
  - 2x [Raspberry Pi B+ Case, Stackable - Additional Level](http://www.ebay.com/itm/271614825269)

Other necessities, which I already had on-hand (but you might need to purchase):

  - Cat 5e or Cat 6 network cable for making patch cords. (I have hundreds of feet of the stuff, and can quickly punch down a patch cable, so I just made my own).
  - A power outlet. (I am planning on adding an inline UPS at some point in the future, and could run the cluster off this for a few minutes at least... so the power outlet is somewhat optional :)
  - A computer to run the Ansible playbooks (you can do it all on the Pis themselves, but I prefer working on my Mac workstation and leaving all the Pis headless).

Other accessories, optional but helpful for general Pi development:

  - [802.11b/g/n USB WiFi adapter](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003MTTJOY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B003MTTJOY&linkCode=as2&tag=httpwwwmidw06-20&linkId=WCTEZWNBLNNQ35E5) (I have a few; handy for getting online away from wired jack)
  - [5mm Diffused RGB LEDs](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006S21SAK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B006S21SAK&linkCode=as2&tag=httpwwwmidw06-20&linkId=2D7X6HRTJFTESGT2) (great for showing status!)
  - [Assembled RPi GPIO Cobbler with 40-pin cable](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00Q1T07O8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00Q1T07O8&linkCode=as2&tag=httpwwwmidw06-20&linkId=JG3OGOMBG75D6BFY) (helpful for prototyping)
  - Half-size breadboard
  - Breadboard/prototyping jumper cables

## Setting up the Pis

### Preparing the microSD cards (with Raspbian)

Download Raspbian from the [Raspberry Pi Operating System Images](http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/) page, and expand the .zip file after it's finished downloading.

You could copy this image file to each of your microSD cards directly using `diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskX` and `sudo dd bs=1m if=/path/to/2015-01-31-raspbian.img of=/dev/diskX` (where `X` is the number for the microSD card on your Mac - found with `diskutil list`), however, I recommend using [`diet-raspbian`](https://github.com/geerlingguy/diet-raspbian) to build a minimal image based off Raspbian.

[`diet-raspbian`](https://github.com/geerlingguy/diet-raspbian) is included as a git submodule inside the `setup` folder, but you should read the instructions included in that project's [README](https://github.com/geerlingguy/diet-raspbian/blob/master/README.md).

The basic process is as follows:

  1. Clone the official Raspbian image to a microSD card and boot a Pi with it.
  2. Trim the fat from the distribution using the included `diet.yml` Ansible playbook.
  3. Resize the partition to a much smaller size (from ~3GB to ~1.25GB).
  4. Clone the new, minified Raspbian image to your Mac.
  5. Copy this new, minified image to all your microSD cards.

`diet-raspbian`'s instructions are very thorough and it should work with the latest build of Raspbian.

### Preparing the Raspberry Pis

Assuming you've cloned a `diet-raspbian`-based image, you shouldn't need to configure the Pis directly (via terminal session with a connected display/keyboard). However, if you use the default Raspbian image, and still need to perform the initial configuration steps (e.g. `raspi-config`), you can still do so headless via SSH:

  1. Find the Raspberry Pi's IP address, and connect via SSH: `ssh pi@[IP-ADDRESS]`
  2. Default username is `pi` and default password is `raspberry`.
  3. Once logged in, run `sudo raspi-config`, and follow the prompts.

Even if you *did* use the `diet-raspbian` image, you may wish to expand the filesystem to fill the entire microSD card on each Pi using the first option in `sudo raspi-config`. We'll go through these steps in detail later.

### Racking the Raspberry Pis

  1. Mount one Pi per tier of the stackable case.
  2. Mount the stack to a board, and mount the network switch and USB power supply as well.
  3. Plug each Pi into one of the power supply's jacks, ensuring any Pis that will be powering extra USB devices (e.g. the database server) is plugged into a 2A port.
  4. Create custom-sized Cat 5e/Cat 6 cables, one-per-Pi, to connect to the network switch.
  5. Run power to the switch and to the USB power supply.
  6. Profit!

### Provisioning the Raspberry Pis

Once all the Pis are booted, and you are able to log into them over the network via SSH, there are a few steps you need to perform before you'll be ready to run the `provision.yml` playbook to provision software to them.

#### Finish Pi configuration with `raspi-config`

The first thing you need to do is finish basic Pi configuration for each Pi:

  1. Log into the Pi directly or via SSH, and run `sudo raspi-config`.
  2. Select 'Expand Filesystem' and then Ok when it's complete.
  3. Select 'Change User Password' if you would like to set a password for the 'pi' account.
  4. Set Overclocking options if you so desire.
  5. Select 'Finish' and restart the Pi so the filesystem is expanded.

> You may also need to run `sudo swapoff --all && sudo rm -rf /var/swap` if you get an 'out of disk space' error in any of the preceding steps.

#### Setting up networking

On each Pi, you will need to log in and do the following:

  1. Set a unique hostname (e.g. `www1.dramble` for the first webserver, and `db1.dramble` for the database server):
    1. Edit `/etc/hostname` and replace the existing hostname with the new hostname.
    2. Enter `hostname [new-hostname]` to update the hostname immediately.
    3. Edit `/etc/hosts` and replace the existing hostname with the new hostname.
  2. Set up the network settings for our Pi network:
    1. Edit `/etc/network/interfaces` and change the `iface eth0 inet dhcp` block to (IP address specific to the server):
        ```
        iface eth0 inet static
          address 10.0.1.60/24
          gateway 10.0.1.1
        ```

    2. Set up DNS resolution in `/etc/resolv.conf` by adding the following lines (using Google DNS, for example):
        ```
        nameserver 8.8.8.8
        nameserver 8.8.4.4
        ```
        (handy one-liner: `printf '%s\n%s\n' 'nameserver 8.8.8.8' 'nameserver 8.8.4.4' >> /etc/resolv.conf`).

    3. Restart the Pi: `sudo reboot`
    4. You'll need to reconnect to the Pi on its new static IP address.

The networking configuration may need to be a little different depending on the environment in which you're using your own Dramble (whether it's on an isolated private network, connected to another network/router, using bridged WiFi interfaces, etc.).

> I used the following hostnames and IP addresses for my Dramble:
>
>   - `bal1.dramble` (10.0.1.60)
>   - `www1.dramble` (10.0.1.61)
>   - `www2.dramble` (10.0.1.62)
>   - `www3.dramble` (10.0.1.63)
>   - `cache1.dramble` (10.0.1.64)
>   - `db1.dramble` (10.0.1.65)

#### Testing Ansible configuration

Once you have all your Pis configured, and the `inventory` file has all the right IP addresses, you can run the following command (within this directory) to test Ansible's ability to see all the Pis:

    $ ansible all -i inventory -m ping

This should return something like:

    $ ansible all -i inventory -m ping
    10.0.1.60 | success >> {
        "changed": false,
        "ping": "pong"
    }
    
    ...
    
    10.0.1.64 | success >> {
        "changed": false,
        "ping": "pong"
    }

If you get a `pong` for each Pi, you're good to go!

Some other interesting Ansible commands you could run to manage your Pis:

    # Get current disk usage.
    $ ansible all -i inventory -a "df -h"
    
    # Get current memory usage.
    $ ansible all -i inventory -a "free -m"
    
    # Reboot all the Pis.
    $ ansible all -i inventory -a "shutdown -r now" -s
    
    # Shut down all the Pis.
    $ ansible all -i inventory -a "shutdown -h now" -s

#### Running `provision.yml`

TODO.

> To un-provision a Pi, you can either use `apt-get remove --purge [package]` and `apt-get autoremove` to remove installed packages/configuration, then reboot... or you can reimage the microSD cards from a fresh copy of Raspbian or `diet-raspbian`. I prefer the latter, but for quick testing/experimentation will do the former.

### Deploying Drupal to the Raspberry Pis

After all the Raspberry Pis are provisioned, it's time to deploy our brand new Drupal 8 site to them!

TODO.
