The humans soon find themselves caught in the middle of a deadly conflict between the two alien races, and must fight for their survival.

AVP: Alien vs. Predator was released in Tamil dubbed version in India in 2004. The film received mixed to negative reviews from critics, who criticized the plot, characters, dialogue and lack of gore. However, some praised the action sequences, creature designs and the performance of Lathan as the lead heroine. The film was a box office success, grossing over $172 million worldwide against a budget of $60 million. It spawned a sequel, Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (2007), which was also dubbed in Tamil.
  
The film features a cast of international actors, led by Sanaa Lathan as Alexa Woods, a tough and resourceful guide who becomes the leader of the human survivors. Lathan was chosen by Anderson because he wanted a strong female protagonist who could hold her own against the aliens and predators. Lathan trained for five weeks in kickboxing, yoga and weapons handling to prepare for the role.
 
Lance Henriksen plays Charles Bishop Weyland, a billionaire industrialist who funds the expedition and is revealed to be the founder of Weyland Industries, a precursor to the Weyland-Yutani Corporation from the Alien films. Henriksen had previously played the android Bishop in Aliens (1986) and Alien 3 (1992), and his character in this film is implied to be the inspiration for the creation of the androids. Henriksen said he enjoyed playing a human character who is \"weak but heroic\".
 
Raoul Bova plays Sebastian de Rosa, an Italian archaeologist who is fascinated by the pyramid and its connection to different ancient cultures. Bova described his character as \"a romantic hero\" who develops a bond with Alexa. Ewen Bremner plays Graeme Miller, a Scottish chemical engineer who provides comic relief. Colin Salmon plays Maxwell Stafford, Weyland's head of security who is loyal but ruthless. Tommy Flanagan plays Mark Verheiden, a mercenary who is an old friend of Alexa's.

The film also features several actors from different countries as members of the expedition, such as Joseph Rye, Agathe de La Boulaye, Carsten Norgaard, Sam Troughton, Petr JÃ¡kl, Pavel Bezdek, Kieran Bew, Carsten Voigt, Jan FilipenskÃ½ and Adrian Bouchet. Andy Lucas plays Juan Ramirez, the captain of the icebreaker that transports the team to Antarctica. Liz May Brice plays a supervisor who monitors the expedition from Weyland's satellite station.
 
The alien and predator creatures were portrayed by actors in suits and animatronics, as well as computer-generated imagery (CGI). Tom Woodruff Jr. and Ian Whyte played Grid and Scar respectively, two of the main alien and predator characters in the film. Woodruff had previously played aliens in Alien 3 and Alien: Resurrection (1997), while Whyte had played various roles in Harry Potter films. The actors had to endure long hours of makeup and prosthetics, as well as performing in heavy costumes that limited their vision and mobility.
