Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 is one of the most popular and beloved games in the franchise, but unfortunately, the official servers for the PC version are no longer active. However, there is a way to play the game online with multiplayer, zombies and all DLC for free, using a mod called Plutonium.
 
Plutonium is a CoD mod that aims to improve upon your favorite games by adding features such as dedicated servers, controller support, anti-cheat, modding support and more[^1^]. It supports Black Ops 1, Black Ops 2, Modern Warfare 3 and World at War.

## Step 1: Download the Game
 
The first thing you need to do is to download the base game files for Black Ops 2. You can use any torrent site or direct download link that you prefer, as long as it contains the full game. Make sure you have enough space on your hard drive, as the game is about 20 GB in size.
 
One of the links that we recommend is this one[^2^], which contains a video tutorial on how to download the game. You will need a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip to extract the files after downloading them.
 
## Step 2: Download the Launcher
 
The next thing you need to do is to download the Plutonium launcher, which is a small program that will allow you to run the mod and join servers. You can download it from here[^1^], by clicking on the "Download" button at the top right corner of the page.
 
Once you have downloaded the launcher, extract it to a folder of your choice. You can name it anything you want, but we suggest something like "Plutonium BO2". Do not put it inside your game folder, as it might cause problems.
 
## Step 3: Register an Account
 
Before you can play online with Plutonium, you need to register an account on their website. This is free and easy to do, just go to this link[^1^] and fill out the form with your username, email and password. You will also need to verify your email address by clicking on a link that will be sent to you.
 
Once you have registered an account, you can log in to the launcher with your credentials. You will also be able to access their forum[^1^], where you can find more information, guides, support and community discussions.
 
## Step 4: Install the Mod
 
Now that you have everything ready, it's time to install the mod and play the game. To do this, open the launcher and click on "Install" next to Black Ops 2. You will be asked to select your game folder, which is where you extracted the base game files in step 1. The launcher will then download and install the mod files automatically.
 
This might take some time depending on your internet speed and computer performance, so be patient and wait until it's done. Once it's finished, you will see a green "Play" button next to Black Ops 2. Congratulations, you have successfully installed Plutonium for BO2!
 
## Step 5: Join a Server
 
The final step is to join a server and play online with other players. To do this, click on "Play" next to Black Ops 2 and select either "Multiplayer" or "Zombies". You will then see a list of servers that are available for each mode. You can filter them by name, map, mode, ping and players using the options at the top.
 
To join a server, simply double-click on it or select it and click on "Join". You will then be connected to the server and start playing. You can also create your own server by clicking on "Host" and choosing your settings. You can also invite your friends by using their built-in friend list feature[^1^].
 
## Enjoy!
