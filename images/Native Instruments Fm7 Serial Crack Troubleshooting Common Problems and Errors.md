A few years ago, I was able to install B4 II, a virtual organ software, on my Windows 10 laptop. Now I have a new laptop with Windows 11 and I'm trying to do the same thing. I used Native Access, a software management tool, to validate my B4 II serial number. However, when I launch B4 II, it still asks me to "Run Demo" instead of letting me use the full version. I can see my serial number in the "about screen" of B4 II, so I don't understand why it doesn't recognize it. I remember that I had to do some "tricks" to make it work on Windows 10, but I can't recall what they were. Does anyone know how to fix this problem and get B4 II working properly on Windows 11?
