# How to Fix TeamViewer Trial Version Expired Error
 
If you are using TeamViewer for remote control and desktop sharing, you may encounter an error message saying "Your trial has expired" after 15 days of installation. This happens if you have selected the commercial or both of the above options during installation, or if your system is running a Windows Server operating system.
 
TeamViewer offers a free version for personal and non-commercial use, as well as a paid version for business and professional use. If you have accidentally installed the commercial version or your trial period has ended, you will need to uninstall and reinstall TeamViewer with the correct option.
