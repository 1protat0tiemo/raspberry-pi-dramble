# How to Use Voidmp3fm-1.10.exe.epub to Transfer Music to Your Sony Walkman
  
If you have a Sony Walkman that supports MP3 files, you might be looking for a way to transfer music from your computer to your device. One of the options is to use the official Sony software, SonicStage, but it has some limitations and compatibility issues. Another option is to use a third-party software called voidMP3FM, which is free and has some features that SonicStage does not.
  
In this article, we will show you how to use voidMP3FM-1.10.exe.epub, which is a file that combines the voidMP3FM software and an ePUB reader. An ePUB reader is a program that can open documents with the ".epub" file extension, which are usually ebooks. By using this file, you can access both the voidMP3FM software and an ePUB reader in one place.
